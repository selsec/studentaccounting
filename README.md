The goal is to take a spreadsheet "uniform" and end up having it look like the fund list. Or have something where I can take the names, grade, and instrument and autocreate the sheets and input the names in the master sheet. 

The real end goal is to not have to spend hours creating each sheet for 70+ students every year. We always end up having the Uniform spreadsheet because it has uniform measurements taken in band camp.
